# ReactionGame
An embedded reaction game made with C++ and Arduino Mega. This was a course project on a course about embedded systems and microcontrollers and it's been created together with my student colleague Havu Kirjalainen.

## What the game is about
The idea of the game is following: there are three LEDs and a button for each LED. A random LED lights up, and there is a short time frame during which the correct button has to be pressed. The time frame shortens round by round and high score is stored in the EEPROM. Instructions are shown on an LCD and appropriate melodies are played in different situations during the game.
